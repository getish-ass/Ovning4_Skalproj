In the begining the list capacity is 4 by default. The capacity of the list increases by four when those four default places are assigned.
It is because the internal array assignment does not do increament with each assignment.
The capacity of the list doesn't decreament when elements are removed.
Using array can be prefered instead of list when the exact number of data need to be impliment are known.

It is not right to use stack for the queue in ICA for att those who get earlier in the queue will get service last.

I think it is right to use stack to solve this problem.
